= Introduction =

Ever needed a command line tool or a Python module for a missing episodes counter, if yes, here is your chance to make your job easier (if there're simular projects, send links to the project owner that's me)


= Details =

The program support
  * File counting in a path
  * makes a list of a virtual files
  * checks which real file names are not in the virtual files
  * prints statistics
  * debug option argument, which makes the program to print out each found and missing file
    name.
In order this program to diff the files, it uses a file match patter, which cuts the starting pattern of the file and the ending extension, so it leaves us the number.

<font color="blue">*TODO:*</font> support end pattern, regex pattern and etc.

So will need to count all the episoded from e.g: foo show, to do that we need to tell out program how much episode does the show/session got, it counts from 1 to max episodes, but what if we burned/deleted/backup-ed the episodes from 1 to 10, in order to count now, and get the correct results I added a minimum episode argument.

<font color="blue">*TODO:*</font> get automaticly the last number of episodes and the first number, asking the user to confirm the founded numbers.
